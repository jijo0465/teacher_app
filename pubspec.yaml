  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/check_attendance.png
    - assets/images/give_rewards.png
    - assets/images/write_remarks.png
    - assets/images/upcoming_exams.png
    - assets/images/track_schoolbus.png
    - assets/images/contact_parents.png
    - assets/images/student_profile.png
    - assets/images/premark.png
    - assets/images/classroom.png
    - assets/images/update_homework.png
    - assets/images/update_testpaper.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-bold.ttf
        
        # - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
          # style: italic
    # - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
